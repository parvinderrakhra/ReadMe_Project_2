In our project we created a Stock Market trading algorithm, using Tesla (TSLA) stock as a baseline. We createdpredicitbve models using 3 techinical indicators (Simple Moving Average, Bolinger Band and Exponential Moving Average) over 5 years of Tesla stock market data. We then then evaluated the performance of the models to determine which had the best predictive power to maximise potential portfolio value. 


## Overview

* We are interested in stock market trading algotrithms

* We used DataReader and yfinance (Yahoo Finance) to obtain our stock market data (TSLA)

* Machine learning models we expect to utilize are:

    * Random Forest
    * Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    * LSTM

* Technical Indicators used:

    * Moving Average of Closing Prices
    * Exponential Moving Average of Closing Prices
    * Exponential Moving Average of Daily Return Volatility
    * Bollinger Band
    * Buy and Hold
